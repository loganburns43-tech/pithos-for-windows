REM Since GStreamer SDK and OSSBuild are a bit difficult to work with, we
REM go through and set things up for the user so they don't need to worry
REM too much about PATH variables being set properly and other madness.

REM Additionally, this script tries to be a bit more verbose and let the 
REM user know more about the errors that they are seeing, instead of just a
REM stack trace.
